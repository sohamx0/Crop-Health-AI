# 🌱 Crop Health Diagnosis & Fertilizer Recommendation System

An AI-driven web application for real-time crop disease detection and fertilizer recommendations using deep learning and large language models.


## 📌 Overview

This system detects plant diseases from leaf images using a **ResNet50 CNN model** and generates **actionable fertilizer recommendations** using the **Gemini Large Language Model (LLM)**.  
It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and usable directly by farmers via a mobile-friendly web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- Image-based plant disease detection (38 disease classes)
- Deep Learning using ResNet50 (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Fertilizer recommendations via Gemini LLM
- Real-time inference (200–400 ms on CPU)
- Flask-based REST API
- No authentication, no database, no data storage
- Privacy-first, in-memory image processing

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Flask  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)  
- Gemini LLM  
- HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript  

## 🏗 System Architecture

- **Client**: Image upload + result display (Web UI)
- **Backend**: Flask API for preprocessing, inference & LLM calls
- **Model Layer**: Fine-tuned ResNet50 CNN

No database or persistent storage is used.

## 🔬 Model Details

- Dataset: PlantVillage
- Input size: 224 × 224
- Output: Multi-class disease prediction
- Activation: Softmax

### Model Accuracy Comparison

| Model          | Accuracy |
|----------------|----------|
| EfficientNetB0 | 97.16%   |
| **ResNet50**   | 97.86%   |
| Custom CNN     | 95.84%   |
| MobileNetV2    | 93.80%   |

ResNet50 was selected for deployment due to accuracy–speed balance.


## 🌾 Fertilizer Recommendation

- Generated using Gemini LLM
- Input: Crop type + predicted disease
- Output: Fertilizers, dosages, and preventive steps
- Human-readable, no rule-based logic


## 🔁 Workflow

1. User uploads a leaf image  
2. Image sent to `/predict_disease` endpoint  
3. Image preprocessing (resize, normalize)  
4. Disease prediction via ResNet50  
5. Fertilizer advice generated by Gemini LLM  
6. Response returned as JSON  
7. Image discarded from memory
